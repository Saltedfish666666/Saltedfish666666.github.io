# Week1 Schedule
On the morning of September 12th, our team held its first offline meeting with Professor Peng Benli at 9:00 a.m. During the meeting, Professor Peng proposed several ideas and plans. After discussing our personal interests and aligning them with Professor Peng's research field, we finalized the project topic as "Research on an Intelligent Anti-Icing System for Ship Hulls Based on Phase Change Materials and Heat Pipe Technology."

# Introduction
The phenomenon of icing has an important impact on the engine performance and water driving ability of ships, so it is necessary to carry out anti-icing tests during the development of ships. Effective anti-icing will have a significant impact on shipping and other fields. The main purpose of the new anti-icing equipment is to design a dual-use anti-icing equipment used on the hull surface or directly placed on the lake surface. The equipment has innovations in surface materials, thermal energy storage and other aspects. During the day, the device absorbs as much solar energy as possible through the light tracking device, and together with the heat energy generated by the engine, it is transmitted from the evaporative section of the heat pipe to the adiabatic section and then to the condensating section, which is stored by the phase change. After the temperature changes at night, the phase changes reversly compared with the day, and the heat energy stored during the day is released, making it difficult for the water near the device to freeze. We expect to make a complete set of equipment this year, which can be used in real life and ensure the integrity of the above functions and advantages. We need to master the knowledge of material science, mechanics and so on. In the equipment surface material coating, we need to find out the special anti-icing materials by searching for information and experiments; In the phase change heat storage, we also need to find out the phase change at the appropriate temperature of the material, as well as the improvement and use of heat pipe.
